 *  Description:
 *  The following example demonstrates how one can use the following APIs:
 *   * `pdcpp::Component` for isolating drawable UI elements
 *   * `pdcpp::Viewport` for creating scrollable UI elements
 *   * `pdcpp::Graphics` for drawing colors and shapes
 *   * `pdcpp::InputContextManager` and `pdcpp::InputContext` for managing what
 *     elements are listening to the crank and buttons at any given time
 *   * `pdcpp::ScopedGraphicsContext` for managing how elements are drawn
